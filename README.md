# 🦠 CoronaVirus Web Scraping and Voice Recognition

A Python project that combines **live web scraping of COVID-19 data** with **voice recognition and speech response**.  
It allows users to ask for coronavirus statistics using voice commands and get spoken answers in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project showcases how to:
- Scrape live COVID-19 data from the web.
- Process and extract relevant data for specific countries or global stats.
- Use speech recognition to take voice commands.
- Convert text results into speech responses.

The goal is to build a **voice-controlled assistant** that gives up-to-date pandemic information — an integration of **data scraping**, **automation**, and **AI-based interaction**.

## 🧠 Features
✅ Fetches **real-time COVID-19 statistics** from trusted sources.  
✅ Supports **voice commands** (e.g., “What are the cases in India?”).  
✅ Gives **spoken responses** using text-to-speech.  
✅ Works hands-free once the program starts.  
✅ Easy to extend for other voice-based data tasks.
